SX1302 LoRa Gateway Corecell project
====================================

## 1. Core library: libloragw

This directory contains the sources of the library to build a gateway based on
a Semtech LoRa SX1302 concentrator chip (a.k.a. concentrator).
Once compiled all the code is contained in the libloragw.a file that will be
statically linked (ie. integrated in the final executable).

The library also comes with few basic tests programs that are used to test the
different sub-modules of the library.

Please refer to the readme.md file located in the libloragw directory for
more details.

## 2. Helper programs

Those programs are included in the project to provide examples on how to use
the HAL library, and to help the system builder test different parts of it.

### 2.1. packet_frowarder ###

The packet forwarder is a program running on the host of a Lora gateway that
forwards RF packets receive by the concentrator to a server through a IP/UDP
link, and emits RF packets that are sent by the server.

Uplink: radio packets received by the gateway, with metadata added by the
gateway, forwarded to the server. Might also include gateway status.

Downlink: packets generated by the server, with additional metadata, to be
transmitted by the gateway on the radio channel. Might also include
configuration data for the gateway.

Please refer to the readme.md file located in the packet_forwarder directory
for more details.

### 2.2. util_net_downlink ###

The downlink packet sender is a simple helper program listening on a single
UDP port, responding to PUSH_DATA and PULL_DATA datagrams with proper ACK, and
sending downlink JSON packets to the socket, with given frame parameters, at
regular time interval.
It is a network packet sender.

It can also be used as a UDP packet logger to store received uplinks in a
local CSV file.

Please refer to the readme.md file located in the util_net_downlink directory
for more details.

## 3. Helper scripts

### 3.1. tools/reset_lgw.sh

This script is used to perform the basic initialization of the SX1302 through
the GPIOs defined by the CoreCell reference design.
It gets the SX1302 out of reset and set the Power Enable pin.
This script is called by every program provided here which accesses the SX1302.
It must be located in the same directory as the executable of the program.

## 4. Compile, install and run instructions

All the libraries and test programs can be compiled and installed from the
root directory of this project.

### 4.1. Clean and compile everything

`make clean all`

### 4.2. Install executables and associated files in one directory

First edit the target.cfg file located in the root directory of the project
in order to configure where the executables have to be installed.

`TARGET_IP` : sets the IP address of the host of the gateway. In case the
project is compiled on the gateway host itself (Raspberry Pi...), this can
be left set to `localhost`.

`TARGET_DIR` : sets the directory on the gateway host file system in which
the executables must be copied. Note that the directory MUST exist when
invoking the install command.

`TARGET_USR` : sets the linux user to be used to perform the SSH/SCP command
for copying the executables.

In order to avoid entering the user password when installing the files, the
following steps have to be followed.

Lets say you want to copy between two hosts host_src and host_dest (they can
be the same). host_src is the host where you would run the scp command,
irrespective of the direction of the file copy!

* On host_src, run this command as the user that runs scp</br>
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`
This will prompt for a passphrase. Just press the enter key. It'll then
generate an identification (private key) and a public key. Do not ever share
the private key with anyone! ssh-keygen shows where it saved the public key.
This is by default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
* Transfer the id_rsa.pub file to host_dest by either ftp, scp or any other
method.
* On host_dest, login as the remote user which you plan to use when you run
scp.
* Copy the contents of id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</br>
`cat id_rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys`</br>
`chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

Now that everything is set, the following command can be invoked:</br>
`make install`

In order to also install the packet forwarder JSON configuration files:</br>
`make install_conf`
